CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory //wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/megaman/Project_prog1/cmake-build-debug/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/2006d/Desktop/project/cmake-build-debug where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "//wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/megaman/Project_prog1/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/Users/2006d/Desktop/project/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
